- **Source**: https://github.com/denehyg/reveal.js-menu

- **Local changes**: none
- **Last verified**: 2025-09-10 with Reveal 5.2.0

## Why vendored?
The plugin is no longer actively maintained but works for our needs. Keeping it vendored prevents flaky CDN/npm drift and ensures predictable builds.

## Update procedure
1. Check upstream (or maintained forks) for fixes or security updates.
2. Replace files in `assets/reveal/plugin/menu/` from upstream (notably `menu.esm.js` and related assets).
3. Local test:
   - `bundle exec jekyll build && bundle exec jekyll serve`
   - Open a Reveal page; verify **Menu** opens and that **Links â†’ Home** appears.
   - Exercise keyboard shortcuts and submenu navigation.
4. Commit with message:
