Due to the COVID pandemic, I have been working remotely since March 2020. I am available via remote technologies such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams. Feel free to schedule time using my "Calendar" page, which you can find in the main navigational menu.  

When I am on-campus, you can find me at the Powerhouse in Durham. For more information on the Powerhouse, visit this [URL](https://oit.duke.edu/about/locations).
