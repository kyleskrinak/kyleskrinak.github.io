## Keynote

* Converting vb-script site to a modern, responsive heterogeneous site with Drupal 8
* Good mix of heterogeneous systems to produce a modern and robust content website, including static pages
* [This blog post](https://evolvingweb.ca/blog/profiling-and-optimizing-drupal-migrations-blackfire) echos much of this keynote discussion


## Accessibility Panel

* Training content editors
    * Incentivize training?
    * Clarifying roles for responsibility
* How the [OCR](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/index.html) is impacting our response, and assigning priorities
* Everyone wants accessibility, but funding implementation efforts remains problematic
