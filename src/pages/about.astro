			<h2>Thanks for stopping by</h2>

			<p>
				Hello and thanks for stopping by. Despite being a full-on Drupal fan, I <a href={linkWithBase("/blog/2016-10-31-first-blog-post/")}>started this blog in 2016</a> as an exercise in using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static website generator and with the <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a> theme. By doing so, I discovered I could easily create a feature-rich web blog only serving HTML resources. No PHP, Python, or the like, running on the server. Plus, Duke offered free static hosting to staff. As in, hey! Free web hosting! Though I left Duke, and their free web hosting, I ended up loving Jekyll as a content platform. At least for now. You know how ephemeral web technologies are.
			</p>

			<p>
				As for my interests; by day, I manage web development and system administration. Otherwise, I am a fan of low-carb eating, as the pages of this blog reflect. I use these topics as excuses for writing on my blog as an excuse to write in Markdown and NeoVim. And write.
			</p>

			<p>
				Currently, I am the Senior Manager of the Digital Experience Platform Team for <a href="https://www.gilead.com/">Gilead Sciences</a>. Our team is responsible for the reliable hosting and management of Gilead's websites. Our main Content Management System is Sitecore and Azure and we also support PHP and static websites on Amazon Web Services.
