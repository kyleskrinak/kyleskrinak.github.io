			<h2>Thanks for stopping by</h2>

			<p>
				Hello and thanks for stopping by. I <a href={linkWithBase("/blog/2016-10-31-first-blog-post/")}>started this blog in 2016</a> as an exercise in using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static website generator with the <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a> theme. I discovered I could create a feature-rich web blog serving only HTML resources—no server-side runtime required.
			</p>

			<p>
				In January 2026, I migrated the blog from Jekyll to <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, a modern static site generator built on <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>. The site now uses the <a href="https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper">AstroPaper</a> theme as a foundation. This migration gave me the chance to modernize the blog's tooling while preserving all the content and history.
			</p>

			<p>
				In 2022, I transitioned away from the Drupal ecosystem after years of working deeply with the platform. While I still respect Drupal and its community, I've been exploring a broader range of technologies and approaches ever since.
			</p>

			<p>
				By day, I manage web development and system administration. My interests span cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure), content management systems, and modern web frameworks. I'm also a fan of low-carb eating, which shows up regularly on this blog. I write in Markdown and NeoVim because I enjoy the simplicity and focus they provide.
			</p>

			<p>
				Currently, I am the Senior Manager of the Digital Experience Platform Team for <a href="https://www.gilead.com/">Gilead Sciences</a>. Our team is responsible for the reliable hosting and management of Gilead's websites, supporting systems like Sitecore, Azure, and AWS.
			</p>

			<h2>Low-Carb Living</h2>
			<p>
				Since June 2017, I've followed a low-carb diet under the guidance of Dr. Eric Westman at Duke University. It's transformed my health and helped me maintain sustainable weight loss. I write about this journey regularly on the blog. For my full story, resources, and recommendations, read <a href={linkWithBase("/lchf")}>my low-carb living page</a>.
