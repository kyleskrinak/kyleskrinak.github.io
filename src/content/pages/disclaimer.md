**Disclaimer:** I am an I.T. manager, and I’m not a doctor, nutritionist, mechanic, acrobat nor dietician. My blog is _my_ sharing of _my_ experiences, which _may_ help more people understand Drupal, website development and hosting, low-carb eating or any of the myriad topics that might tickle my muse. The content here reflects my usually correct, but sometimes misguided or misinformed opinions and do not reflect those of my employer nor the nearest Grocery Boy, Jr., to where you are currently located. While I try to reference my sources, this is an informal blog and I promise you, I will screw up. This is even true of the content related to my day job. Stuff will be missing or _flat-out wrong_ and shame on you for not doubting me. I do not provide this content for medical, legal, tax, emotional or metaphysical advice. If anything I write inspires you to try something different, you’re at your own risk. As the king of this tin-pot content kingdom, I reserve the right, nay, I _demand_ the right, to change the focus or content as I may flippantly wish.

I followed [Raelyn Tan’s](https://raelyntan.com/ "How to write a blog") guidance on disclaimers and [this link](https://raelyntan.com/write-blog-disclaimer/ "How to write a blog disclaimer") is a bow to her prowess. Thanks, person I’ve never met!
