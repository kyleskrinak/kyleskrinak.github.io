Here's [an excellent article](https://opensource.com/article/17/2/vim-plugins-writers) on using Vim for narrative writing, as opposed to technical documentation. I love the idea of an immediate editor for the kind of lazy checking I like to do before I share something I've written.

While reading this article, I see attention drawn to NeoVim. Never heard of it before. "Vim, but better" is what they claim, as new forks always do. Worth checking out, anyhow.
