The Higher Ed Summit organizers had considerably redesigned the schedule and makeup of the summit. I say to a significantly improved format. 

This year, we:
* Introductions and the usual keynote start
* Held three sessions of three concurrent presentations, broken out by interest, i.e., marketing or back-end
* Lunch
* A “Solutions” meeting with randomized attendees, sever per table
* Three 15-minute presentations to all members
* Concluding thoughts
* A closing mixer with a networking game that was surprisingly effective. Even considering the introverted nature of Higher Ed IT professionals.

_Note: The summit website (live-seattle-hes.pantheonsite.io) has been decommissioned and the content was never archived._


## EduDU

* We strongly encourage using the [EduDU Slack group](https://edudu.org/) and the #drupalcon channel to connect with other higher-ed professionals at DrupalCon, plan BoFs and braindates, and keep in touch with attendees after the conference.
* Please fill out the form at the [EduDU website](https://edudu.org/) to receive an invite link. Non-edu email addresses will be removed from the Slack team, so make sure to use your work email addresses when signing up.

## Opening session

* [Paul Grotevant](https://sites.utexas.edu/drupal/author/pfg/ "Paul Grotevant's blog at U.T. Austin") presents on new summit format
* “Braindates” continue the conversation afterwards
  *  Connection opportunities.
* The Solution problem

## 10:45 AM &mdash; My Presentation

You can find my slide-deck [here](/presentations/2019-drupalcon-drupal-8-multisite.html).

My presentation on DevOps, Drupal 8 and Multi-site represents the culmination of three year’s work from our team’s investigation and implementation of the very topic. Of course we’re all very busy, and we’ve been putting such narratives to low priority for our support and standard daily tasks. Despite all this hard work, we’re still very much at draft status.

My own increasing managerial duties, and decreasing tech duties, have rusted my familiarity with the technical aspects. As the date approached, my unpreparedness mocked my empty slide-deck. I cursed myself many times for agreeing to do this. In retrospect, I’m glad I did. I also discovered the myriad documentation our team has created in support of this effort.

The meeting generated interest, and a group of attendees and I discussed various related matters after my presentation. The discussion we held helped to raise new questions and answer others we’ve been kicking around. This is the fruit of contributing back to the community. You always get more back than you put in. The nature of our discussion led me to miss the next scheduled presentations, but my other team members were able to attend these and brief me on what they learned.

Finally, my extensive preparation for this session paid off later in the week, at the Duke annual TechExpo presentation. We had a cancellation due to illness and needed to fill an open slot on the schedule. That’s for a later post.

## Lunch

Lunch was delicious and fully-compatible with my low-carb way of eating. Better was the company and information we gathered while we ate. While we talked a variety of topics, configuration management (CM) was front and center. We enjoyed the illuminating company of Shawn DeArmond, University of California, Davis, and his insights on CM. He offered his qualified opinions on what makes sense, and I have a new YouTube video to watch.

## 1:00 PM &mdash; Solutions session

As we filtered into the room, Paul handed each attendee a table number. This assured randomized seating so that we couldn’t sit with our “normal” crowd. The rules for engagement were simple. Write down your greatest pain points. In round-robin fashion, share them with the table. Next, each person leads with their problem and we collaborate towards a possible solution.

My problem was around how to cultivate new talent, especially from underrepresented communities. This led to a fascinating discussion and back and forth on how to do so. One of the possible suggestions was to seek out the growing use of bootcamp-style training that has been growing nationally.Seek connections with these groups, and possibly offer mentoring.

## 2:00 Lightning Rounds

I’ll have to dig into my notes for this

### DevOps for a small team

## 4:00 PM &mdash; closer and mixer
