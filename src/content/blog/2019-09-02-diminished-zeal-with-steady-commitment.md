## After 2+ years, the loss continues

Though my LCHF journaling has been quiet, don’t let my silence fool you. I have been thoroughly enjoying low-carb living and its consequences. My initial excitement was my finding actual validation in what I had read in Atkins diet books fifteen or more years ago. Even better, Dr. Westman’s guidance helped me exceed where my read of Atkins had failed. As I type this post, 2 years and 2 months in, I am maintaining my weight loss, increasing my health, and enjoying life as I had not expected at my age.

If all is so great, you might think my zeal would stoke my muse, that I’d write more. While I love to write, there’s a flipside to public professions. Someone I love dearly, changed her eating to a low-carb diet. She dropped 50 pounds and said she never felt better. “Why don’t you blog about it? You can inspire others to give it a go.” I asked. 

She responded; 

> “I’ve spent my whole life with my weight problem hovering over every aspect of who I am. I don’t want my weight, to be a ‘thing’ with me. I want it all behind me.” 

It didn’t hit me until a couple of days later what she was saying, and I love that reaction. Isn’t this how it should be? Our culture is drenched in a quasi-nutritional patter about fiber, cholesterol, exercise, how “bad” one is to want “one more pie,” and so on. We should eat, enjoy what we eat, and live. 

### We should eat to live, not live to eat.
