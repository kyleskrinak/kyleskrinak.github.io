#### Origins for the Drupal module project

---

* A re-org at Duke
* Office of Information Technology’s call for Code+ projects
* A mutually-beneficial project
  * Supports the Code+ team, Drupal, Open Source, and Duke
* Duke maintains an internally-developed module on D.O. in need of attention
  * AKA “BasicShib” [https://www.drupal.org/project/basicshib](https://www.drupal.org/project/basicshib)
* A Duke need: integrate Grouper with Shibboleth

<!-- Note: Summer Experience Co-Curricular Project

##### Drupal Module for Software Design and Development

The Drupal open-source software platform provides an opportunity for those who wish to design, develop, release, and finally maintain a non-commercial software project. A team of students will work with Duke’s Office of Information Technology and other partners across campus to develop a Drupal module to extend the functionality of the existing framework to create an application. Students will work with Drupal 9 to extend Symfony’s PHP object model paradigm. This allows students to work within a fully compliant Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP, paradigm.
