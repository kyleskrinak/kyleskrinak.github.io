* *BlueSpark* as I was favorably impressed by their COO’s presentation. Marketing guy is a Duke Fuqua grad. Perhaps I can pick the COO’s brain about other performance measurements and capability assessment?

## [Don’t trust your gut: agency operations metrics](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/dont-trust-your-gut)

### Session summary by presenter:
I’ll admit it, I love spreadsheets.  So when I attended a session by Sean Larkin* called, [“Scaling your business starts with the right spreadsheets: performance metrics”](https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/scaling-your-business-starts-right-spreadsheets-performance-metrics) at Drupalcon LA, I was excited to take what I had learned and apply it to my own agency.   I was inspired.   I immediately adopted these same spreadsheets and started adapting them to fit my needs as Chief Operating Officer.

* [Billable hours matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FORnelNjLv-g8uLoHThcn-036l5-kOboC5e3Y4qUngg/edit)
* [Megasheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FORnelNjLv-g8uLoHThcn-036l5-kOboC5e3Y4qUngg/edit)

* Stepping through measurements and their impact on constraints
* Cost recovery and profit focused, but still valid capacity, capability and status measures

## [A smarter Way to Test Accessibility - a comparison of top tools (Lighthouse, Tenon.io and WAVE API)](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/smarter-way-test-accessibility-comparison-top-tools-lighthouse-tenonio-and)

* What should automated web accessibility tell us?
* Tools
  * Lighthouse (Google)
  * Tenon (commercial)
  * WAVE (commercial)
  * Types of tools
    * Dev-facing
    * Compliance-facing
  * Comparison of the above
  * Lighthouse has an API and a Node package 
      * Runs script as a pre-commit git hook
  * AI can better help with accessibility analysis

## [How to build a Drupal site with Composer AND keep all of your hair](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/how-build-drupal-site-composer-and-keep-all-your-hair)

This session will cover everything you need to know to build and maintain a Drupal application using Composer. We'll start Merriam Webster's definition of Composer (not really) and walk you through step-by-step until you have a fully built Drupal codebase. There's no prior knowledge or experience required. But if you're already a seasoned Composer user, we've got a few tips for you too!

* Covered basics
* Drupal template project
* Drupal module updates
* what required-dev is for
* Reduced production deployments
* You can find this code here: https://grasmash.github.io/drupal-composer-training/#create-a-new-project

## Good-bye DrupalCon
