* A re-org at Duke

## A Code+ Project is born

### Drupal Module for Software Design and Development

The Drupal open-source software platform provides an opportunity for those who wish to design, develop, release, and finally maintain a non-commercial software project. A team of students will work with Duke’s Office of Information Technology and other partners across campus to develop a Drupal module to extend the functionality of the existing framework to create an application. Students will work with Drupal 9 to extend Symfony’s PHP object model paradigm. This allows students to work within a fully compliant Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP, paradigm.

---

* Code+ administrators assigns five students to project
* We discuss project, training, and software requirements  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Lando for development.
  * Identify common means for collaboration.
* Daily check-in and check-out on Microsoft Teams and Zoom <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * We had a mix of on-campus and remote students across time zones.
  * Encourage team collaboration on a standard platform.

## Project Challenges

* What on earth is Drupal?
  * Well, about that
* Rising sophomores who have never collaborated in this fashion
  * A highly effective team
* Uneven engagement and enthusiasm
  * In the end, all were “all in.”
* No initial team cohesion
  * Genuine team bonding and fondness

I asked for help, and the Drupal community responded!

* Marc Isaacson ([vegantriathlete](https://www.drupal.org/u/vegantriathlete)), Precious McKoy ([mckoypr](https://www.drupal.org/u/mckoypr)), Jay Beaton ([jrb](https://www.drupal.org/u/jrb)), Iain Hadgraft ([iaha](https://drupal.org/u/iaha)), Eric Sembrat ([webbeh](https://drupal.org/u/webbeh))

* The team also asked questions on the Slack Drupal channel [#contribute](https://drupal.slack.com/archives/C1BMUQ9U6) with strong community engagement.
