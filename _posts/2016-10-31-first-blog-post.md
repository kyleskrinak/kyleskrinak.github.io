Despite being an ardent Drupal fan, I also love statically-served sites for many reasons, especially for the freely available static-site services that Duke and GitHub makes available. For now I'm getting up and running on Jekyll using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. This theme has a lot of features baked in, so I can focus on getting up and running. Plus I don't have to provision a web server, PHP, MySQL or Maria, and so on.
