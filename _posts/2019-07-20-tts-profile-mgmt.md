# What we’re covering today

----

## Updating:

----

* Updating faculty and staff profile data
* Department group membership not in Scholars
* Assigning administrative assignments



# Who Does What?

----

* _Content editors_ are responsible for the content of their website.
* Your _power users_ are responsible for updating profile information
  * Any department member may update his or her profile as well
  * The Scholars list of power users is here: https://about.scholars.duke.edu/locate-power-user
* The _TCA&S team_ is responsible for the reliable operation of our directory 
* The _Scholars team_ manages the Scholars web site and data interaction



# Where to Make Profile Updates?

* We support Duke’s “System of Record.”
* https://directorytool.trinity.duke.edu
  * https://directorytool.trinity.duke.edu/help/profile-data-source  
Handy reference
* scholars.duke.edu
* Your department’s website for any unique profile data
* The next two slides provide a different view of the data sources

![Non-Scholars member data flow]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/member_NOT_in_Scholars.png "Non-scholars member data flow")



# Remember

1. Your group’s profile data also goes to trinity.duke.edu’s master directory for all Trinity College of Arts &amp; Sciences members.  
https://trinity.duke.edu/directory
2. You may have to wait up to 48 hours to see your profile changes apply to your web site.
3. What about unpublished department member nodes?



# Who Do I Contact for Help?

----

* **Simple rule:** Confirm Scholars profile data. If Scholars data is incorrect, then contact your power user.
* If Scholars profile data is correct, but your website’s data is incorrect, then contact:

----

trinitywebsupport@duke.edu  
*And not any single TCA&S staff member’s address, please.*
