I will be leading two sessions at the [DrupalCon Higher Education Summit](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/higher-ed-summit) on Monday, April 8th, 2018, and I&rsquo;m using this post for my preparation notes.

You can find all the virtual directory for all the Higher Education Summit Session notes [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uaFfgSob8VHlIpvb1WNMi_UdYdrYXwTA).  

**Note:** these agenda items are not hard-and-fast discussion items. Depending on session attendees and details I cannot anticipate, these discussions tend to grow a life of their own. I find that nearly always, the actual discussion turns out far better than I anticipate. *Caveat lector.*

## Session 1; 11:20 AM &ndash; 12:20 PM
### Continuous Integration / Continuous Development Strategies

* **Introductions**   
Tell us your name, title, what you do, and your efforts at CI/CD so far?
* What is Continuous Integration / Continuous Development (CI/CD)? What is it NOT?
    * Continuous integration is the integration of code commits with building, testing and deploying these commits. (1)
* **What are the tools and components of CI/CD?** What are you using? (1) 
    * Gitlab-ci, Jenkins, Circle-CI, Travis, git-commit hooks
    * Ansible, Git workflow, dev vm or docker, task runners, package managers, repositories
    * Functional testing, Behat testing, coding standards, linting, static analysis
    * Deploy, pipelines, stages and tasks
At Duke's Trinity School of Arts &amp; Sciences, we're using [gitlab-ci](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/). We have used Jenkins, we still have a 2-year old Jenkins server, but we prefer gitlab-ci.
* How long have you been using CI/CD?
* What benefits have you seen because of your adoption?  
    * Improving quality, consistency and process speed
How would you like to extend your CI/CD adoption?
* What are some blockers or obstacles to implementation?
* Examples or potential CI/CD workflows
* Examples of shared CI/CD resources
