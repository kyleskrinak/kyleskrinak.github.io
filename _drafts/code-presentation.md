## Origins for the Drupal module project

---

* A COVID-driven reorganization within Duke
* Office of Information Technology’s call for Code+ projects
* A mutually-beneficial project
  * Supports the cohort, Drupal, Open Source, and Duke
* Duke maintains an internally-developed module on D.O. in need of attention
  * AKA “BasicShib” https://www.drupal.org/project/basicshib
* A Duke need: integrate Grouper with Shibboleth
