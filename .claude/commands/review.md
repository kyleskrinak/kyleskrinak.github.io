description: Review draft for logic and flow without rewriting
---

You are reviewing my blog post draft. Read the file I specify and provide structured feedback.

Focus areas (in priority order):
1. **Logic & Argument Flow**
   - Are the main points clear and well-supported?
   - Do the sections flow logically?
   - Are there gaps in reasoning or unsupported leaps?
   - Does the conclusion follow from the argument?

2. **Structure & Transitions**
   - Is the organization effective?
   - Are transitions between sections smooth?
   - Does the pacing work?

3. **Clarity & Precision**
   - Are any claims vague or ambiguous?
   - Are technical terms used correctly?
   - Is anything unnecessarily complex?

Output format:
```
## Logic & Flow
- [Issue]: [Specific location/paragraph]
- [Why it's a problem]
- [Suggestion for fixing]

## Structure & Transitions
- [Same format]

## Clarity Issues
- [Same format]

## What Works Well
- [Brief list of strong points]
```

Critical rules:
- Do NOT rewrite my prose
- Do NOT alter my narrative voice
- Point out problems and explain WHY they're problems
- Leave the actual fixing to me
- Be specific about locations (paragraph numbers, section headers)
- Flag issues, don't silently fix them

If the draft has no significant issues, say so clearly.
