description: Search codebase efficiently without reading entire files

Search for: $ARGUMENTS

Process:
1. Use grep/ripgrep to find matches (don't read files yet)
2. Show me top 5 most relevant file paths
3. Ask which files I want to examine in detail
4. Read ONLY the selected files

This prevents reading unnecessary files and saves tokens.
