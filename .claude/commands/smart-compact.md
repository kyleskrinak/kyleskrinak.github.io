description: Smart compact that preserves code and decisions
---

Compact this conversation with focus on:

1. Code snippets and file paths modified
2. Key decisions made and rationale
3. Open TODOs or next steps
4. Error messages or bugs encountered

Exclude:
- Exploratory discussions
- Repeated explanations
- Verbose output from commands

After compacting, summarize what was preserved in 3-5 bullet points.
