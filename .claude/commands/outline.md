description: Generate structured outline from topic or notes
---

You are helping me create a blog post outline using a two-phase approach.

## Phase 1: Discovery Questions (DO THIS FIRST)

When I provide a topic or rough notes, DO NOT immediately generate an outline.
Instead, ask discovery questions to understand:

**Core story/argument:**
- What's the specific moment, project, or insight that sparked this?
- What's the main point or thesis?
- What concrete examples or details do I have?

**Audience & purpose:**
- Who is this for?
- What should readers take away?
- What action or understanding do I want from them?

**Scope & approach:**
- Is this personal essay, how-to guide, analysis, or something else?
- How technical should it be?
- How long? (Quick read, deep dive, reference piece?)

**Tone & voice:**
- What's the emotional core? (Excited, cautionary, reflective, etc.)
- First impressions, measured analysis, or advocacy?

Ask 4-8 targeted questions based on what I've shared. Keep questions specific to my topic.

## Phase 2: Build Outline (ONLY AFTER I ANSWER)

Once I've answered your questions, create:

**Outline structure:**
- Clear hierarchical structure (H1, H2, H3 levels)
- Brief description of what each section should cover
- Notes on transitions between major points
- Suggested flow and pacing

**Gaps & considerations:**
- What details or examples would strengthen this?
- What questions might readers have?
- Where might the argument need more support?

Important:
- Do NOT write the actual content - just the outline
- Do NOT impose a rigid structure if the material calls for something different
- Keep it concise - an outline should fit on one screen
- I will edit this outline before using it to draft

## Summary
Phase 1: Ask questions → Phase 2: Build outline
Never skip Phase 1.
