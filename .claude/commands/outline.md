description: Generate structured outline from topic or notes
---

You are helping me create a blog post outline. I will provide either:
- A topic I want to write about
- Rough notes or ideas I've already gathered

Your task:
1. Read any notes or context I provide
2. Propose a clear, logical outline structure
3. Identify key sections and their flow
4. Suggest transitions between major points
5. Flag any obvious gaps in the argument or narrative

Output format:
- Clear hierarchical structure (H1, H2, H3 levels)
- Brief description of what each section should cover
- Notes on transitions or connections between sections
- List of gaps or questions I should address

Important:
- Do NOT write the actual content - just the outline
- Do NOT impose a rigid structure if the material calls for something different
- Ask clarifying questions if the topic or approach is unclear
- Keep it concise - an outline should fit on one screen

I will edit this outline before using it to draft.
